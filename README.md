gDoorReviews.py is my first "major" (still elementary but I'm happy with it) scraping project. It should be able to scrape any reviews pages. 

Currently, you do have to put in the last part of the URL manually (that represents review page being scraped).

When opening the CSV.. better to not delineate with ';' because some answers have that

todo:
    - Add automatic page traversal
    - Add the "Recommends", "Company Outlook", "Approves of CEO" section

Initial commit 2x months ago, deleted and repushed, added randomUserAgents.py and getPages().
